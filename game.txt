Dark Souls 2
The worst part of the series, I recommend playing only if you are a big fan of the series. The bosses are complete crap, I only liked one of the DLCs, the rest are complete garbage. There are a lot of mobs on your locks that prevent you from reaching your boss. And in principle, the design of everything is much worse even than the FIRST PART DS. Again, only play if you're sooooo big fan of the whole series
